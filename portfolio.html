            <h4>Student's Information</h4>
            <p>Yusra Yahya, student of grade 9-H, studying under the most trusted and upgrded platform APS COD Karachi, is a brilliant student (GOAT). She should be the principal. She is the most innocent and quitest girl in this year's badge and she's a good listener also. She have so many friends so her main focus is to irritate and and enjoy :).</p>

            <h4>Progress Report</h4>
            <p>Although she is not interested in biology, she id dtill trying to do better. Her main focus is on computer science so I suggest to change her subject as soon as possible. But still, she is continously doing efforts to improve in biology and keeps learning new things and concepts to score good. The only thing that needs focus is that she don't participate wilingly in class, she knows the answer but don't participate untill we ask her and she lack alot of confidence. In short, she's an excellent student but needs to participate more in school  and other activities also.<br>
